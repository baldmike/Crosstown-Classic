# Crosstown-Classic
They made it!  YOU made it!  Welcome to the 2020 meeting between the White Sox and the Cubs. Unattractively coded, statistically inaccurate and ineptly styled (but fully functional) baseball game in Python 2.7.13 and Django 1.11.3
Play all 9 as the 2005 World Champion Chicago White Sox host the 2016 World Champion Chicago Cubs at Trubisky Park.
